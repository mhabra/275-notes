# Math 275 Notes
---

These are my notes for Math 275. They're in markdown, so open them in your favorite markdown viewer. I like the [Markdown viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en) extension for Chrome because it renders math and Latex formulas, which is something Github does not do.


Send me pull requests if you want to change anything.
I also pdfs of the notes, so if you want to just use the pdfs instead of the original markdown.
